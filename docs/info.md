## How it works
A D flip-flop is a digital circuit that stores a single bit of data.
It's a clocked sequential logic circuit, meaning it changes its output
based on the data input and a clock signal. Essentially, it captures
and holds the value present at its input (D) when the clock signal
transitions from low to high (rising edge).
## How to test
Refer to the state table of a d flip-flop.
